# Wifi Christmas Tree - Web Code
Just a big mess of web code that I used to control the wifi christmas tree boards

Hey, it was my first time working with paper.js - give me a break. 

This code could do with a lot of work, but it works. Might be something to come back to...

I grabbed the music from here: www.freexmasmp3.com

You will need to add the following to a /imgs/ folder:
* tonybg.png - Background when tony tree is active
* jinijinbg.png - Background when jinijin tree is active
* lunchbg.png - Background when lunch tree is active
* LogoRezare_212x124.png - logo down the bottom that plays music
